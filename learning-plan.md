# Linux Learning Plan

## Week 1: Basic Command Line Navigation
 * **Learn:** Basic commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`)
 * **Practice:** Navigating the file system, creating and deleting directories and files, copying and moving files.
 * **Exercise:** Set up a directory structure with files, then practice navigating and manipulating directly through the CLI.

## Week 2: Understanding and Using Shell
 * **Learn:** Basics of the shell (bash), environment variables, using `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
 * **Practice:** Customizing your shell prompt, creating and using aliases, and environment variables.
 * **Exercise:** Create custom aliases for commonly used commands and set environment variables you might need.

## Week 3: File and Directory Management
 * **Learn:** Advanced file operations (`find`, `grep`, `locate`, `du`, `df`, `ln`).
 * **Practice:** Searching for files, checking disk usage, creating and managing hard and symbolic links.
 * **Exercise:** Find and list files by size, type, or modification date, and practice linking files.

## Week 4: File Permissions and Ownership
 * **Learn:** File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`), understanding unmask.
 * **Practice:** Changing file permissions, ownership, and group settings.
 * **Exercise:** Set up different directories with various permissions and practice changing and managing these permissions.

## Week 5: Process Management
 * **Learn:** Managing processes (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `htop`, `bg`, `fg`, `jobs`, `nohup`).
 * **Practice:** Monitoring system processes, killing or suspending processes, running jobs in the background.
 * **Exercise:** Manage long-running processes and background jobs.

## Week 6: Text Processing Tools
 * **Learn:** Text manipulation (`cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, `tail`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `sed`, `awk`, `tr`).
 * **Practice:** Combining and manipulating text data in files.
 * **Exercise:** Extract specific data from a text file, process it, and output it to a new file. 

## Week 7: Networking Basics
 * **Learn:** Networking commands (`ifconfig`, `ip`, `ping`, `netstat`, `ss`, `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`).
 * **Practice:** Checking network status, downloading files, connecting to remote servers.
 * **Exercise:** Set up a basic SSH connection and transfer files between machines using `scp` or `rsync`.

## Week 8: Scripting Basics
 * **Learn:** Introduction to bash scripting, variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
 * **Practice:** Writing basic scripts to automate simple tasks.
 * **Exercise:** Create a script that automates a daily task, such as backing up files or cleaning up directories.

## Week 9: Advanced Scripting
 * **Learn:** Advanced bash scripting techniques, handling user input, script debugging.
 * **Practice:** Writing more complex scripts with functions and error handling.
 * **Exercise:** Develop a script to automate a more complex process like setting up a new environment or managing services.

## Week 10: System Monitoring and Performance Tuning
 * **Learn:** System monitoring tools (`vmstat`, `iostat`, `sar`, `free`, `uptime`, `dstat`).
 * **Practice:** Monitoring system performance, identifying bottlenecks, understanding logs.
 * **Exercise:** Analyze system performance and suggest optimizations on command-line tools.

## Week 11: Disk Management and Partitioning
 * **Learn:** Disk utilities (`fdisk`, `parted`, `mkfs`, `mount`, `unmount`, `df`, `lsblk`).
 * **Practice:** Creating and managing partitions, file systems, and mounting / unmounting drives.
 * **Exercise:** Set up a new partition, format it, and mount it for use.

## Week 12: Package Management and Software Installation
 * **Learn:** Managing packages (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `snap`, `dpkg`, `rpm`).
 * **Practice:** Installing, updating, and removing software from the command line.
 * **Exercise:** Install a series of software packages, resolve dependencies, and troubleshoot issues without using a GUI.

## Week 13: Security and User Management
 * **Learn:** User management (`useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `groups`, `sudo`), basic security practices.
 * **Practice:** Creating and managing users, groups, and permissions, using `sudo` effectively.
 * **Exercise:** Set up a secure environment, configure SSH keys for secure access, and review security settings.

## Final Week: Comprehensive Project
 * **Project:** Implement a project that integrates all the skills you have learned over the 13 weeks. This could be setting up a fully functional server, creating a complex automation script, or managing a system entirely through the CLI for a week without using the GUI.
