## Why Learn Linux?

I ascribe my desire to learn Linux and the command line to a collection of things. Raspberry Pi projects kicked
off my interest first, and then I switched from a PC to a Mac and noticed the similarities in the command line. 
My work exposed me to various other aspects of computing - automation, scripting, `gcloud` command line tools. 
The deeper I got, the more I understood how important it all is to understand Linux and shell scripting within 
the broader technology landscape.

## How to Learn Linux

My first step was to do what anyone else should do when they decide they want to learn something. I asked ChatGPT 
to provide a few resources and create a [13-week learning plan]! This learning journey began with the best of 
intentions, and then work happened. And the holidays happened. 13 weeks have come and gone, but I'm still at it 
and will continue documenting my learning journey in the [wiki].

## Open Questions
### Week 2
 - [ ] How can I add other things to my prompt like repo name, git branch, VPN status, etc.?

### Week 3
 - [ ] Is `locate` deprecated or not included in certain Linux versions?
 - [ ] I understand the `ln` command but not the true usefulness of links.
