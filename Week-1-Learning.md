# Week 1: Basic Command Line Navigation

## Learn: Basic commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`)

Biggest learnings here include:
 * My favorite arguments for the `ls` command are `ls -laAhF`
   * `-l` displays results in long format
   * `-a` displays all files, including hidden .
   * `-A` excludes . (current directory) and .. (parent directory)
   * `-h` displays file sizes in human-readable format rather than bytes
   * `-F` appends a classifier character to the ends of each listed name
 * The `rm` command must include the `-r` argument to recurse through directories
 * The `touch` command can be used to change the last update date for files

## Practice: Navigating the file system, creating and deleting directories and files, copying and moving files.

 * Practice here was relatively straightforward and did not present any issues for me.

## Exercise: Set up a directory structure with files, then practice navigating and manipulating directly through the CLI.

 * I went through the exercise without any difficulties.
